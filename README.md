# Replace words in a file

The title says (almost) it all.

Replace words in a text file via the command-line. That's it.  Basically the program takes an input file, replaces the words you want and outputs it to a new file.

Because I'm too lazy to open Office programs I spent hours coding this for myself :)

## Parameters for use

    --input-file            # path to input file.
    --output-file           # path to output file.
    --original              # original word you want to replace.
    --replacement           # replacement word.
